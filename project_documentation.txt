# Recruitment Assistant Agent - Project Overview

## What is this project?
This project is a smart, conversational AI assistant designed to help users create job openings on the Simplify platform. Instead of forcing users to fill out long, complex forms, they can simply talk to the assistant like they would a colleague.

## What does it do for the user?

### 1. Natural Conversation
The assistant talks in a friendly, professional manner. It doesn't act like a robot reading a script. You can greet it, ask how it is, or jump straight into work. It remembers what you said earlier in the conversation (like your name or the job title you mentioned 5 minutes ago), so you don't have to repeat yourself.

### 2. Intelligent Job Creation
The core purpose is to draft a "Job Requisition". The assistant helps you:
- **Define the Role:** "I need a Python Developer."
- **Set the Scope:** Project-based or Staff Augmentation? Hourly or Fixed Price?
- **Fill Details:** It asks for necessary details (Location, Start Date, Rates, Manager) *one by one* in a natural flow, rather than overwhelming you with a checklist.

### 3. Context Awareness
- **Remembers Context:** If you say "The budget is $50/hr", it remembers that. If you later say "actually make it $60", it updates the draft.
- **Smart Defaults:** It uses the platform's data to find available Managers, Hierarchies, and Templates so you don't have to guess IDs or codes.
- **Guidance:** If you aren't sure about a field, it guides you based on the rules of the platform (e.g., verifying if overtime is allowed).

### 4. Seamless Handoff
Once the assistant has collected all the necessary information through chat, it prepares the job draft and hands it over to the main system, allowing you to review and click "Submit" with a single click.

## Key Features
- **Zero-Form Experience:** Create complex jobs entirely through chat.
- **Smart Search:** Finds Managers and Hierarchies by name automatically.
- **Persistence:** It remembers your conversation history and the current state of your job draft, even if you step away and come back.
